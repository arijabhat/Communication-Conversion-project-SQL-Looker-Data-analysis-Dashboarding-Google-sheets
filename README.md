# Communication-Conversion-project-SQL-Looker-Data-analysis-Dashboarding-Google-sheets
Insight generation of the communication volume to find out the pick up rate and meaningful call rate for all operational locations at each milestone.
In this project, I extracted total number of outbound calls, number of calls that were answered to find out the pick up rate. A high pick-up rate suggests that contacts are reachable and that the calling strategy (timing, number used, etc.) is effective.To evaluate our outreach efficiency, I calculated the Pick-up Rate over a 4-week period. This helped identify optimal calling hours and improved agent productivity.
The Meaningful Call Rate refers to the percentage of calls that result in a productive or goal-oriented interaction, such as a lead conversion, appointment booking, or sales discussion. It measures how many calls are valuable. It’s a key indicator of script effectiveness, agent communication skills, and lead quality.I extracted data as Total answered calls & number of calls meeting the criteria of “meaningful” (as defined by business objectives which is 90 min).To assess the quality of engagements, I tracked the Meaningful Call Rate. This helped distinguish between merely answered calls and those driving business outcomes.
Trend Over Time: Showed how these rates change weekly/monthly.
By Agent/Team: Compared performance across staff.
By Time of Day: Are certain times leading to better pick-up or meaningful rates?
Correlation with Outcomes: Do higher meaningful call rates correlate with actual sales?
